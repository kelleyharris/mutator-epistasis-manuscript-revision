### A novel method for detecting mutator alleles

We developed a statistical method, termed "inter-haplotype distance" (IHD), to detect loci that are associated with mutation spectrum variation in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (Figure {@fig:distance-method}; *Materials and Methods*). 
Our approach leverages the fact that mutator alleles often leave behind distinct and detectable impressions on the *mutation spectrum*, even if they increase the overall mutation rate by a relatively small amount.
Given a population of haplotypes, we assume that each has been genotyped at the same collection of biallelic loci and each harbors *de novo* mutations that have been partitioned by $k$-mer context (Figure @fig:distance-method).
At every locus, we calculate a cosine distance between the aggregate mutation spectra of haplotypes that inherited either parental allele.
Using permutation tests, we then identify loci at which those distances are larger than what we'd expect by random chance.
To account for polygenic effects on the mutation process that might be shared between BXDs, we also regress the cosine distance at each marker against the genetic similarity between haplotype groups, and assess significance using the fitted residuals (which we call the "adjusted" cosine distances) (*Materials and Methods*).

Our method's power is primarily limited by the initial mutation rate of the $k$-mer mutation type affected by a mutator allele and the total number of *de novo* mutations used to detect it (Figure {@fig:simulations}). 
Given 100 haplotypes with an average of 500 *de novo* germline mutations each, IHD has approximately 90% power to detect a mutator allele that increases the C>A *de novo* mutation rate by as little as 20%. 
However, the approach has less than 20% power to detect a mutator of identical effect size that augments the C>G mutation rate, since C>G mutations are expected to make up a smaller fraction of all *de novo* germline mutations to begin with. 
Simulations also demonstrate that our approach is well-powered to detect large-effect mutator alleles (e.g., those that increase the mutation rate of a specific $k$-mer by 50%), even with a relatively small number of mutations per haplotype (Figure {@fig:simulations}).
Both IHD and traditional quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping have similar power to detect alleles that augment the rates of individual 1-mer mutation types (Figure {@fig:ihd_vs_qtl_power}), but IHD has a number of potential advantages for mutator allele discovery; for a more detailed comparison of the methods, see the *Discussion*.

**Overview of inter-haplotype distance method for discovering mutator alleles.** 
**a)** A population of four haplotypes has been genotyped at three informative markers ($g_1$ through $g_3$); each haplotype also harbors unique *de novo* germline mutations.
In practice, *de novo* mutations are partitioned by $k$-mer context; for simplicity in this toy example, *de novo* mutations are simply classified into two possible mutation types (grey squares represent C>(A/T/G) mutations, while grey triangles represent A>(C/T/G) mutations).
**b)** At each informative marker $g_n$, we calculate the total number of each mutation type observed on haplotypes that carry either parental allele (i.e., the aggregate mutation spectrum) using all genome-wide *de novo* mutations. 
For example, haplotypes with *A* (orange) genotypes at $g_1$ carry a total of three "triangle" mutations and five "square" mutations, and haplotypes with *B* (green) genotypes carry a total of six triangle and two square mutations.
We then calculate the cosine distance between the two aggregate mutation spectra, which we call the "inter-haplotype distance." 
Cosine distance can be defined as $1 - \cos(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is the angle between two vectors; in this case, the two vectors are the two aggregate spectra.
We repeat this process for every informative marker $g_n$. 
**c)** To assess the significance of any distance peaks in b), we perform permutation tests. 
In each of $N$ permutations, we shuffle the haplotype labels associated with the *de novo* mutation data, run a genome-wide distance scan, and record the maximum cosine distance encountered at any locus in the scan. 
Finally, we calculate the $1 - p$ percentile of the distribution of those maximum distances to obtain a genome-wide cosine distance threshold at the specified value of $p$.

### Re-identifying the mutator allele on chromosome 4 in the BXDs

We applied our inter-haplotype distance method to 117 BXDs (*Materials and Methods*) with a total of 65,552 *de novo* germline mutations [@PMID:35545679]. 
Using mutation data that were partitioned by 1-mer nucleotide context, we discovered a locus on chromosome 4 that was significantly associated with mutation spectrum variation (Figure {@fig:distance-results}a; maximum adjusted cosine distance of 1.20e-2 at marker ID `rs27509845`; position 118.28 Mbp in GRCm38/mm10 coordinates).

**a)** Adjusted cosine distances between aggregate 1-mer *de novo* mutation spectra on BXD haplotypes (n = 117 haplotypes; 65,552 total mutations) with either *D* or *B* alleles at 7,321 informative markers. 
Cosine distance threshold at p = 0.05 was calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD mutation data, and is shown as a dotted grey line. 
**b)** Adjusted cosine distances between aggregate 1-mer *de novo* mutation spectra on BXD haplotypes with *D* alleles at `rs27509845` (n = 66 haplotypes; 42,171 total mutations) and either *D* or *B* alleles at 7,276 informative markers. 
Cosine distance threshold at p = 0.05 was calculated by performing 10,000 permutations of the BXD mutation data, and is shown as a dotted grey line.

Using quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, we previously identified a nearly-identical locus on chromosome 4 that was significantly associated with the C>A germline mutation rate in the BXDs [@PMID:35545679]. 
This locus overlapped 21 protein-coding genes that were annotated by the Gene Ontology as being involved in "DNA repair," but only one of those genes contained non-synonymous differences between the two parental strains: *Mutyh*. 
*Mutyh* encodes a protein involved in the base-excision repair of 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), a DNA lesion caused by oxidative damage, and prevents the accumulation of C>A mutations [@PMID:28551381;@PMID:28127763;@PMID:17581577]. 
C>A germline mutation rates are nearly 50% higher in BXDs that inherit *D* genotypes at marker ID `rs27509845` (the marker at which we observed the highest adjusted cosine distance on chromosome 4) than in those that inherit *B* genotypes (Figure @fig:spectra-comparison) [@PMID:35545679].

### An additional germline mutator allele on chromosome 6

After confirming that IHD could recover the mutator locus overlapping *Mutyh*, we asked if our approach could identify additional mutator loci in the BXDs. 
In particular, we were interested in discovering epistatic interactions between alleles at the chromosome 4 locus and mutator alleles elsewhere in the genome.
We hypothesized that such interactions could be detectable by first "conditioning" on the presence of *B* or *D* alleles at the mutator locus on chromosome 4, and then running another genome-wide scan for loci associated with mutation spectrum variation.
To account for the effects of the large-effect mutator locus near *Mutyh*, we divided the BXDs into those with either *D* (n = 66) or *B* (n = 44) genotypes at `rs27509845` (n = 7 BXDs were heterozygous) and ran an inter-haplotype distance scan using each group separately (Figure {@fig:distance-results}b and @fig:distance-results-conditioned).

Using the BXDs with *D* genotypes at `rs27509845`, we identified a locus on chromosome 6 that was significantly associated with mutation spectrum variation (Figure {@fig:distance-results}b; maximum adjusted cosine distance of 3.68e-3 at marker `rs46276051`; position 111.27 Mbp in GRCm38/mm10 coordinates).
This signal was specific to BXDs with *D* genotypes at the `rs27509845` locus, as we did not observe any new mutator loci after performing an IHD scan using BXDs with *B* genotypes at `rs27509845` (Figure @fig:distance-results-conditioned).
We also performed QTL scans for the fractions of each 1-mer mutation type using the same mutation data, but none produced a genome-wide significant log-odds score at any locus (Figure {@fig:qtl-scans}; *Materials and Methods*).

We queried the region surrounding the top marker on chromosome 6 (+/- 5 Mbp) and discovered 63 protein-coding genes, of which five were annotated with a Gene Ontology [@PMID:10802651;@PMID:33290552] term related to "DNA repair": *Fancd2*, *Mbd4*, *Ogg1*, *Rad18*, and *Setmar*.
Of these, only three harbored nonsynonymous differences between the parental C57BL/6J and DBA/2J strains (Table @tbl:nonsyn-diffs). 
*Ogg1* encodes a key member of the base-excision repair response to oxidative DNA damage (a pathway that also includes *Mutyh*), *Mbd4* encodes a protein that is involved in the repair of G:T mismatches caused by spontaneous deamination of methylated CpGs, and in mice *Setmar* encodes a SET domain-containing histone methyltransferase.

Table: Nonsynonymous mutations in DNA repair genes near the chr6 peak {#tbl:nonsyn-diffs}

We also considered the possibility that expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), rather than nonsynonymous mutations, could contribute to the C>A mutator phenotype associated with the locus on chromosome 6. 
Using GeneNetwork [@PMID:27933521] we mapped cis-eQTLs for the five aforementioned DNA repair genes in a number of tissues, though we did not have access to expression data from germline cells. 
*D* alleles near the cosine distance peak on chromosome 6 were significantly associated with decreased *Ogg1* expression in kidney, liver, and gastrointestinal tissues; *D* alleles were also associated with lower *Rad18* expression in the retina (Table @tbl:eqtl-results). 
The cis-eQTLs that lead to decreased *Ogg1* or *Rad18* expression are challenging to interpret, however, given their tissue specificity and our lack of access to germline expression data. 

Finally, we queried a dataset of structural variants (SVs) identified via high-quality, long-read assembly of inbred laboratory mouse strains [@doi:10.1016/j.xgen.2023.100291] and found 136 large insertions or deletions within 5 Mbp of the cosine distance peak on chromosome 6. 
Of these, four overlapped the exonic sequences of protein-coding genes (Table @tbl:sv-overlap), though none of the genes has a previously annotated role in DNA binding, repair or replication, or in a pathway that would likely affect germline mutation rates.
Two protein-coding genes that are involved in DNA repair (*Mbd4* and *Rad18*) harbored intronic insertions or deletions (Table @tbl:sv-overlap); however, additional experimental evidence will be needed to probe the functional impact of these SVs.

### Evidence of epistasis between germline mutator alleles

Next, we more precisely characterized the effects of the chromosome 4 and 6 mutator alleles on mutation spectra in the BXDs. 
On average, C>A germline mutation fractions were significantly higher in BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci than in BXDs with *D* alleles at either locus alone (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}a and @fig:spectra-comparison-all). 
Among BXDs with *B* alleles at the locus overlapping *Mutyh*, those with *D* alleles on chromosome 6 did not exhibit significantly elevated C>A mutation fractions (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}a). 
After controlling for inbreeding duration, we can see that C>A *de novo* mutation counts are always highest in BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}b).
After 100 generations of inbreeding, BXDs with *D* alleles at both mutator loci were predicted to have 238.9 C>A mutations (95% CI: 231.4 - 246.4), about 20% more than the 199.0 mutations (95% CI: 193.3 - 204.7) predicted in those with *D* and *B* alleles at the chromosome 4 and chromosome 6 loci, respectively (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}b).

We also used SigProfilerExtractor [@PMID:36388765] to assign the germline mutations in each BXD to single-base substitution (SBS) mutation signatures from the COSMIC catalog [@PMID:30371878].
Mutation signatures often reflect specific exogenous or endogenous sources of DNA damage, and the proportions of mutations attributable to particular SBS signatures can suggest a genetic or environmental etiology.
The SBS1, SBS5, and SBS30 mutation signatures were active in nearly all BXDs, regardless of genotypes at the chromosome 4 and 6 mutator loci (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}c).
However, the SBS18 signature, which is dominated by C>A mutations and likely reflects unrepaired DNA damage from reactive oxygen species, was almost exclusively active in mice with *D* alleles at the chromosome 4 locus; the highest SBS18 activity was observed in mice with *D* alleles at both mutator loci (Figure @fig:spectra-comparison).
SBS18 activity was lowest in mice with *D* alleles at the chromosome 6 mutator locus alone (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison}c), further demonstrating that *D* alleles at this locus are not sufficient to cause a mutator phenotype.

To more formally test for statistical epistasis, we fit a generalized (Poisson) linear model predicting counts of C>A mutations in each BXD as a function of genotypes at `rs27509845` and `rs46276051` (the markers with the largest adjusted cosine distance at the two mutator loci); the model also accounted for differences in inbreeding duration and sequencing coverage between the BXDs (*Materials and Methods*). 
A model that included an interaction term between genotypes at the two markers fit the data significantly better than a model including only additive effects (p = 7.92e-7; *Materials and Methods*).

**BXD mutation spectra are affected by alleles at both mutator loci.** 
**a)** C>A *de novo* germline mutation fractions in BXDs with either *D* or *B* genotypes at markers `rs27509845` (chr4 peak) and `rs46276051` (chr6 peak). Distributions of C>A mutation fractions were compared with two-sided Mann-Whitney U-tests; annotated p-values are uncorrected. `B-B` vs. `B-D` comparison: U-statistic = 149.0, p = 7.58e-2; `B-D` vs `D-D` comparison: U-statistic = 21.0, p = 2.61e-8; `D-B` vs `D-D` comparison: U-statistic = 232.5, p = 6.99e-5.
**b)** The count of C>A *de novo* germline mutations in each BXD was plotted against the number of generations for which it was inbred. 
Lines represent predicted C>A counts in each haplotype group from a generalized linear model (Poisson family, identity link), and shading around each line represents the 95% confidence interval.
**c)** Germline mutations in each BXD were assigned to COSMIC SBS mutation signatures using SigProfilerExtractor [@PMID:36388765]. After grouping BXDs by their genotypes at `rs27509845` and `rs46276051`, we calculated the fraction of mutations in each group that was attributed to each signature. The proposed etiologies of each mutation signature are: SBS1 (spontaneous deamination of methylated cytosine nucleotides at CpG contexts), SBS5 (unknown, clock-like signature), SBS18 (damage by reactive oxygen species, related to SBS36 and defective base-excision repair due to loss-of-function mutations in MUTYH), and SBS30 (defective base-excision repair due to NTHL1 mutations).

To explore the effects of the two mutator loci in other inbred laboratory mice, we also compared the germline mutation spectra of Sanger Mouse Genomes Project (MGP) strains [@PMID:21921910]. 
Dumont [@PMID:30753674] previously identified germline mutations that were private to each of the 29 MGP strains; these private variants likely represent recent *de novo* mutations (Figure {@fig:spectra-comparison-mgp}). 
Only two of the MGP strains possess *D* genotypes at both the chromosome 4 and chromosome 6 mutator loci: DBA/1J and DBA/2J. 
As before, we tested for epistasis in the MGP strains by fitting two linear models predicting C>A mutation counts as a function of genotypes at the two mutator loci. 
A model incorporating an interaction term did not fit the MGP data significantly better than a model with additive effects alone (p = 0.806), so we are unable to confirm the signal of epistasis; however, this may be due to the smaller number of MGP strains with *de novo* germline mutation data.

### Only one of the candidate mutator alleles is present in wild mice 

To determine whether the candidate mutator alleles on chromosome 6 were segregating in natural populations, we queried previously published sequencing data generated from 67 wild-derived mice [@PMID:27622383]. 
These data include three subspecies of *Mus musculus*, as well as the outgroup *Mus spretus*. 
We found that the *Ogg1* *D* allele was segregating at an allele frequency of 0.259 in *Mus musculus domesticus*, the species from which C57BL/6J and DBA/2J derive the majority of their genomes [@PMID:17660819], and was fixed in *Mus musculus musculus*, *Mus musculus castaneus*, and the outgroup *Mus spretus* (Figure @fig:wild-afs).
The *Setmar* p.Ser273Arg *D* allele was also present at an allele frequency of 0.37 in *Mus musculus domesticus*, while *D* alleles at the *Setmar* p.Leu103Phe variant were not observed in any wild *Mus musculus domesticus* animals.
Notably, *D* alleles at the *Mbd4* p.Asp129Asn variant were absent from all wild mouse populations (Figure @fig:wild-afs).
